Event Check In
=========

Event Check In is a mobile phone application to provide electronic ticket check ins using QR codes. It will scan a QR code printed on a ticket and, using a generic REST API, attempt to check in the ticket with the configured server endpoint. The application is designed to be used with a server which you implement that exposes a REST API that conforms to the required QR Check In server API. This allows web sites that need ticketing to implement QR code check ins without having to develop a mobile phone application.

Please see the [project page](http://skeary.github.io/QRCheckIn/) for further details.
